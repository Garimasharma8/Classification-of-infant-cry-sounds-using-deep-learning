# Classification-of-infant-cry-sounds-using-deep-learning
Objective: We have data for infant cries for 5 different classes including tired, hungry, discomfort, burping, and belly pain. 
Challenges: The dataset is highly imbalanced, and hence applying and analyzing results would not be meaningful. 
Solution: Before designing a classifictaion model, the data from minority classes are augumented by implementing SMOTE. 

Methodology adopted: We have created spectrogram images from cry sounds and pass it to the CNN to perform classification. The CNN model proposed is:

The other parameters are: 
loss function = catergorical cross entropy
optimizer = adam
activation function = ReLu (for inner layers) and softmax (output layer).
epochs = 100
batch_size = 32

The model's accuracy and loss function's graph are:
